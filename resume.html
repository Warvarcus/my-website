            <h3><strong>2021-2022 | Sogeti, a Capgemini Company</strong></h3>
            <h4>Associate Engineering Consultant</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Gained experience in the consumer technology and
                    construction sectors while working alongside
                    companies such as Dell to develop software and deliver
                    new versions of their apps used for internal operations.
                </li>
                <li>Worked as the lone developer and quality engineer
                    for Granite Construction on an Excel add-in that pulled
                    financial data from a database to populate
                    spreadsheets. Stuck to a list of requirements that
                    needed to be met by a deadline while periodically
                    presenting to senior level employees the additions and
                    changes made to the add-in.
                </li>
                <li>Conducted weekly data stewardship activities on 300
                    records at Dell, ensuring precision and accuracy by
                    meticulously verifying data integrity, while proposing
                    alternatives for inaccuracies. Additionally, contributed
                    to enhancing the user interface for data stewards
                    through quality engineering efforts and played a pivotal
                    role in training an AI data steward alongside a
                    collaborative team of stewards.

        <h2 class="d">Projects</h2>
        <h3><strong>Sims' Swim School</strong></h3>
        <h4>Front-End Development</h4>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a website for my mother's swimming lessons
                    business. Created a landing page with a menu that can
                    take users to an about page, an FAQ page, and to a
                    sign-up page.
                </li>
                <li>The sign-up page outlines requirements and information
                    that students or parents need before signing up. Then
                    asks for relevant information from them to get them
                    scheduled for their desired sessions.
                </li>
                <li>This helps streamline the sign-up process. Whereas previously,
                    users had to send emails with their information to be
                    manually sorted before being signed up.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3><strong>Medical Data Page</strong></h3>
        <h4>Front-End Development</h4>
        <div>
             <ul>
                 <li>Recreated a website mockup, converting it from an adobe XD page
                     to HTML.
                 </li>
                 <li>The website brings in data to populate the page with information. The data
                     is username and password protected. These authentication values are input
                     into a .js file and this allows the data to come in.
                 </li>
                 <li>This project was a skills test for a job application. I was asked not to
                     post my work online as it may be used to complete the test illegitimately.
                     However, I'll happily provide the file upon request.
